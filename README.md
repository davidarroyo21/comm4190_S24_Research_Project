# COMM4190 Spring 2024 - Research Project

## Project Overview

Social Penetration Theory developed to explain human communication behavior and explore its implications for communicating with (in both senses) an LLM. I will be examining the ineractions between customer and service representative at Dunkin' Donuts and explore whether and how LLMs might be used and the associated implications.

To accomplish this, I will utilize both academic research, as well as conducting field research using ChatGPT to act out a number of live scenarios.

## Method


1. Conduct academic research
2. Using academic research, develop set of scenarios to conduct with ChatGPT 4
3. Run through each communication scenario with ChatGPT 4 and record each conversation transcript
4. Use transcript to inform paper content
